# Vacuum Cleaner Simulation

This project is a simple simulation of a vacuum cleaner agent implemented in Python with a graphical interface using Tkinter.

## Features

- Simulates a two-location environment (A and B).
- Implements a table-driven agent to make decisions based on perceptions.
- Displays the environment's current state and the agent's actions in real-time.
